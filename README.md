# Duty solicitor rota automation
This is a project to automate the creation of duty rotas for the Defence Solicitor Call Centre (DSCC). 

The rotas are created by the Duty Performance Team (which is a team within the Criminal Finance Team of the Legal Aid Agency). They are published [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/duty-solicitors-rotas-information-and-guidance). These rotas are created every 6 months, and published in April and October.

This was originally a project started by a group of students working with ATOS. We intend to convert this from a desktop application to a Spring Boot web application.

### Building the app
`./gradlew build`
